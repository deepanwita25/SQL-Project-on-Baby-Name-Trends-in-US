# SQL Project on Baby Name Trends
 This is my first SQL project on GitHub. I have always referred to peoples' projects published here and hoped to share my projects also. AND TODAY IS THE DAY!!! This is my first SQL project on GitHub and I want to acknowledge that I came across this project in DataCamp.

 In this SQL Project, I have worked with csv dataset comprising names of babies in USA. I have uploaded the dataset (usa_baby_names.csv) for reference. This dataset has 4 columns namely:
> year
> first_name
> sex
> num ( denoting number of babies of a particular first_name, year and sex)

The objective of the project was to answer few critical questions as follows:
1. Which are the first names that have been there for 101 years (the dataset ranges from 1920 through 2020) and what is the number of babies with the respective names?
2. Which names are Classic, Semi-Classic, Trendy and Sem-Trendy based on the occurence of the name in the dataset over years?
3. Which are the Top 10 female names in the dataset based on the number of babies given that name?
4. WHich are the Top male names for all the years between 1920 and 2020?
5. Which male names have been number one for the largest number of years?

To answer the above questions I have used the basic SQL statements like SELECT FROM, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, subquery, Inner Join, Aggregate Functions. The bonus is that I have also used Intermediate SQL concepts like Common Table Expression (CTE), OVER(), PARTITION BY. 

Hopefully, it will help someone who is new to SQL and is looking for a dataset to practice these critical concepts like RANK(), CTE and OVER()

The SQL queries are present in the pdf for reference.
